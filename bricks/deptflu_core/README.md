_Generated by [mason][1] ðŸ§±_

## Getting Started ðŸš€

Create an empty folder with your app's name. Then initialize mason within it:

```shell
mason init
```

Head to `mason.yaml`, then add lines to the `bricks` section:

```yaml
# Register bricks which can be consumed via the Mason CLI.
# Run "mason get" to install all registered bricks.
# To learn more, visit https://docs.brickhub.dev.
bricks:
  # Bricks can be imported via version constraint from a registry.
  # Uncomment the following line to import the "hello" brick from BrickHub.
  # hello: 0.1.0+1
  # Bricks can also be imported via remote git url.
  deptflu_core:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/rahardien/deptflu.git
      path: bricks/deptflu_core
  deptflu_feat:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/rahardien/deptflu.git
      path: bricks/deptflu_feat
  deptflu_model:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/rahardien/deptflu.git
      path: bricks/deptflu_model
  deptflu_bloc:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/rahardien/deptflu.git
      path: bricks/deptflu_bloc
```

after that run `mason get` to download bricks from the repository.

### Usage

Make sure you're under project's root directory. Then run and fill the rest

```shell
mason make deptflu_core
```

You'll see that the template for your Flutter project  will be generated in current directory.

Happy coding! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰
